Evolution and biochemistry of digital microbes


General
-------

The basic idea for this project is to simulate microbial evolution using simplified biochemistry and genetics.

All chemistry is based on string splitting and concatenation.  Genomes code directly for operators (analogous to proteins) that accept reactant strings and generate product strings.  Chemical energy is used and produced by these reactions so that there is some measure of how fit an organism is.  Each organism is basically a cell that contains a genome and a set of molecules.  Molecules diffuse on a grid, enter and leave cells, and are acted upon by the cytosolic proteins.

Organisms are judged based on their energy pools at the end of a generation, then the winners reproduce with mutation, and the next generation begins.  Mutation can include structural variants, like large scale insertions or deletions, as well as SNPs.  Genomes are long strings that can code for multiple proteins, but they may also contain pseudogenes and runs of noncoding DNA.  This allows genomes to gain and lose functionality over generations and makes them more robust to mutation.
